 Destinations must be a string

 Activities must be a string
 Activities have a price (float), length of time anticipated (integer), and whether or not it needs to be booked in advance (boolean of true/false)

I'm moving to Spain in October, so I'm thinking it would be fun to do an activities list, organized by destinations. 
Each destination has many activities (ie the destination of Alicante has activities of surfing, wine tasting, and hiking), and each activity has only one destination (you can only go surfing in Alicante for example, not in Granada). 
So the models are Destination and Activity. 
For functionality, I am thinking that I want to create a list of all the destinations I'd like to visit, and then when I select a destination, I'd like to be able to see available activities at that destination. 
Each activity would have a price, a time duration, and whether or not it needs to be booked in advance (true/false). 
I'd like to be able to add, update, or delete activities, and I'd like to be able to go back and view my destination list. 
I'd also like to be able to add, update, and delete destinations. 
I'd also like to be able to view all the activities at once and be able to select one to see its associated destination.
